                                acids found in wine, which will affect how acidic a wine tastes. The most prevalent 
                                acids found in wine are tartaric acid, malic acid, and citric acid.

                                The amount of chloride in wine is influenced by both the terroir and type of grape, 
                                and the importance of quantification lies in the fact that wine flavor is strongly 
                                impacted by this particular ion, which, in high concentration, gives the wine an 
                                undesirable salty taste.

                                and smell of wine. Specifically, lower pH levels are associated with tart and crisp 
                                flavors. Many white wines, for example, are known for being both crisp and tart. </td>

                                low amounts actually preserve the flavors. Due to the power of sulfites to stop bacteria 
                                and yeast from growing, they also prevent the creation of a hard boiled egg smell or 
                                flavor that can occur in wines not properly produced.</td>

                                Some everyday wines are made by simply adding sweeteners, such as preserved grape juice, to dry 
                                wines before bottling to make them more palatable.
